    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>  Take whole wheat flour (atta) in a bowl. Sift the flour with salt if you have flour which has a lot of bran. Add a bit of water, oil or ghee and start mixing.</li>
      <li>  Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.</li>
      <li>  Continue to knead the dough. Keep on adding water as required.</li>
      <li>   Knead the dough till it becomes pliable, smooth and soft. The final dough consistency should not be very sticky or loose or hard.</li>
      <li>  Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it.</li>
      <li>  Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.</li>
      <li>  Keep the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Cook on medium-high to high heat for about 30 seconds or so until you see some air pockets all over.</li>
      <li> Flip the chapati and spread some oil all over while the second side is getting roasted. Cook the second side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
      <li>  Flip again with a spatula. You will see that the second side is well roasted with some blisters and brown spots.</li>
      <li>  Spread some oil on this cooked side. Roast the first side again for about 20 to 30 seconds.</li>
      <li> Remove and transfer to a chapati container or box. Keep covered. Make chapati with the rest of the dough in this manner.</li>
    </ol>
