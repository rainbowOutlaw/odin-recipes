        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup moong dal (split and hulled mung lentils)</li>
            <li>⅓ cup onions  finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup tomatoes chopped</li>   
            <li>1 inch ginger finely chopped or minced</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon red chili powder or ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon turmeric powder (ground turmeric)</li>
            <li>1.5 cups water for pressure cooking salt as required</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>  First rinse the moong lentils a couple of times in water. Drain the water and set the lentils aside.</li>

          <li>   In a 3 litre stove-top pressure cooker take the rinsed lentils, chopped onions, chopped tomatoes and finely chopped ginger. Also add the turmeric powder, red chili powder and water to the cooker. Mix well.</li>

          <li>   Pressure cook for 5 to 6 whistles on medium flame till the moong lentils are softened well. Once the pressure settles down, remove the lid and stir the dal.</li>

          <li>   If the dal looks thick, then add some water and simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. </li>

          <li>   Add salt. Mix very well and keep aside. Check the taste and if required you can add more salt. </li>

          <li>     In a small pan, heat oil or ghee or butter. First fry the cumin seeds.</li>

          <li>    Next add the garlic and green chili and fry for some seconds. Don't brown the garlic. Switch off the flame.</li> 

          <li>     Now add the garam masala powder, red chili powder and asafoetida. Switching off the flame earlier ensures that the spice powders don't get burned.</li>

          <li>     Quickly stir and immediately pour the tempering mixture in the dal.</li>

          <li>    Stir the dal and serve hot moong dal with steamed rice or chapatis.</li> 

          <li>     The moong dal tadka tastes better as it is and there is no need to garnish or add coriander leaves to it.</li>

          <li>     But if you want you can always garnish with some coriander leaves. For a slight tang you can also squeeze some lemon juice.</li>
        </ol>
